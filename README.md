# Welcome to Rn Widgets ðŸ‘‹

For this project, I was unable to create and test a widget from a conventional way given that I need AppGroups. I did several workarounds using SwiftUI and a deeplink for handling communication between the widget and the Expo layer.

## Installation

- Clone this repository
- Install dependencies
```
cd rn-widgets
yarn
yarn pods
```
- Run the app
```
yarn start:tunnel
```
and run it via Xcode `xed ios`

or 
```
yarn ios
```
